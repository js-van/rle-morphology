API
=====
There are four different functions exported by this library.

### `dilate(volume, structuring_element)`
This dilates a volume by the structuring element.  The structuring element is represented by a flat list of points, for example the output from one of the methods in `rle-stencils`.

### `erode(volume, structuring_element)`
Erodes the volume by the element.  The basic input and behavior is consistent with `dilate`.

### `opening(volume, structuring_element)`
Performs a morphological opening.  This is useful if you want to remove tiny features your shape.  It is equivalent to doing:

    dilate(erode(volume, element), element)


### `closing(volume, structuring_element)`
Performs a morphological closing.  This removes any tiny holes or cracks in your shape.  It is equivalent to:

    erode(dilate(volume, element), element)
